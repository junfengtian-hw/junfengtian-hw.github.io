# 1st Speech Assignment (April 7, 2016): American Slang(英语的俚语)

## Assignment: Give a 3-4 minute speech on American slang words and expressions

Pick **four(4)** American English slang expressions to introduce to the class.  
You can pick any words on my list. The list is to make sure you find words that are still commonly used. 
 - Explain the meaning of the slang words or expression.
 - Any interesting history or other knowledge (only if necessary)
 - Give an example of how the slang would be used in a sentence or situation.
 - Make a power point presentation (PPT) to help present the words to your audience –if you are talking in class.
    - Bring the PPT to class on a USB drive. 


**No two students may talk about the same word, so we will have an email chain for students to claim their words.**

Half of the class will give this speech in class. The other half will make digital recordings of themselves giving the speech and either send to me via email, USB transfer, or upload online and send me a link to the video.  IF YOU MAKE A VIDEO, you do not need a PPT. 

For the second speech (May 5th) the two groups will switch. 

On April 7, everybody will come to class. Half the class will present their speeches in class. Everybody else will send me their video.  While students present, classmates will listen and write down new slang words.
