# A Long way to Go Alone

I  will record the longly path for me to go through, and I wannna say, "fuck the ugly body and mind of mine". 



## 2017-07-21

I wanna to change now. It is a lonely way to go, so dear tian, **keep your mind open and clear**, which means:
- **live a healthy life**. JL
- do not hesitate to thank them who offer you their kindness, and do not be shy!
- **keep focusing on the main problem**.
  - do not be easily attracted by others papers.
  - do not forget to commnunicate with your boss! (for her advice)
- do not give too high confidence to yourself, but appreciate others for their excellent work. (especially in papers!!)
- I do not who are my friends for I nearly know nothing about who could offer me what I need 
  - who know that I am not well now
  - who could discuss with me
  - who could liston to my complainment
 
 
 1. 修改low-resouce sts task代码
 - 利用configparser让代码易读性变高了
 - Next: Multi-Basic Model (明天完成)
 
 2. 和Catz交流
 - matching feature能有效提升性能
 
 3. chat with ZHANG
 a little disappointed. I feel she do not want to talk to me. -> GIVE UP.
